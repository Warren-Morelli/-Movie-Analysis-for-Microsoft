## Title - Factors That Determine Successful Film

**Authors**: Warren Morelli

## Overview

In this project, I analysed a wide range of film databases from various sources (Bom, IMDb, etc), to come up with an understanding of what factors make a film successful and I have translated that into an actionable plan to help the decision-makers at Microsoft decide what type of film to create. 

After analysing the data, I have come to the conclusion that the main factors that determine whether a movie is successful are genre, release month, film runtime and production budget. Here are a couple of main points from my findings below:

Musical and fantasy are the genres that produce the highest profit, followed by action, adventure and animation. 
Films released in May-July and November are more successful, this is related to the most popular holidays in the US. 
Films with a runtime of 100 - 140 minutes are the most profitable. And there is a strong correlation between films with higher production budgets and films that produce higher revenue.


## Business Problem

Microsoft wants to get the most out of their investment in the movie industry. In order for them to achieve this, I have been tasked with determining what type of films they should create. The following questions were addressed:

1- What are the most crucial factors that determine whether a movie is most profitable?

2- Is there enough data to be able to analyse these factors?

3- What are the most successful genres?

4- What is the ideal runtime for a profitable film?

5- Which months are films the most successful?

6- Does a higher production budget equal higher revenue?


## Data

My data was taken from Bom, IMDb & TN movie datasets which included films dated from 2010 and later.

The films revenues came from TN & Bom. This was connected to the IMBd data to compare the revenue and profits with the runtimes, release dates, genres and production budget, as I found these to be the most crucial factors for a successful film.


## Results

My analysis leads me to 4 clear recommendations I can confidently provide that will produce the most successful film.

1. Musical and fantasy are the genres that produce the highest profit, followed by action, adventure and animation.

2. The ideal runtime for a film is between 100 - 140 minutes.

3. The months that generate the most revenue are May to July and November. These dates seem to align with the 3 biggest holidays in the US which can explain the increase in revenue.

4. There is a strong correlation between a higher production budget and higher revenue simply meaning, the higher your production budget, the more revenue the film will produce.
